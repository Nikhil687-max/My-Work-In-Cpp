    <h2 id="heading-part-1-introduction-to-linux">Part 1: Introduction to Linux</h2>
    <h3 id="heading-11-getting-started-with-linux">1.1. Getting Started with Linux</h3>
    <h4 id="heading-what-is-linux">What is Linux?</h4>
    <p>Linux is an open-source operating system that is based on the Unix operating system. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 1991.</p>
    <p>Open source means that the source code of the operating system is available to the public. This allows anyone to modify the original code, customise it, and distribute the new operating system to potential users.</p>
    <h4 id="heading-why-should-you-learn-about-linux">Why should you learn about Linux?</h4>
    <p>In today's data center landscape, Linux and Microsoft Windows stand out as the primary contenders, with Linux having a major share.</p>
    <p>Here are several compelling reasons to learn Linux:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><p>Given the prevalence of Linux hosting, there is a high chance that your application will be hosted on Linux. So learning Linux as a developer becomes increasingly valuable.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>With cloud computing becoming the norm, chances are high that your cloud instances will rely on Linux.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Linux serves as the foundation for many operating systems for the Internet of Things (IoT) and mobile applications.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>In IT, there are many opportunities for those skilled in Linux.</p>
    </li>
    </ul>
    <h4 id="heading-what-does-it-mean-that-linux-is-an-open-source-operating-system">What does it mean that Linux is an open-source operating system?</h4>
    <p>First, what is open source? Open source software is software whose source code is freely accessible, allowing anyone to utilize, modify, and distribute it.</p>
    <p>Whenever source code is created, it is automatically considered copyrighted, and its distribution is governed by the copyright holder through software licenses.</p>
    <p>In contrast to open source, proprietary or closed-source software restricts access to its source code. Only the creators can view, modify, or distribute it.</p>
    <p>Linux is primarily open source, which means that its source code is freely available. Anyone can view, modify, and distribute it. Developers from anywhere in the world can contribute to its improvement. This lays the foundation of collaboration which is an important aspect of open source software.</p>
    <p>This collaborative approach has led to the widespread adoption of Linux across servers, desktops, embedded systems, and mobile devices.</p>
    <p>The most interesting aspect of Linux being open source is that anyone can tailor the operating system to their specific needs without being restricted by proprietary limitations.</p>
    <p>Chrome OS used by Chromebooks is based on Linux. Android, that powers many smartphones globally, is also based on Linux.</p>
    <p><strong>What is a Linux Kernel?</strong></p>
    <p>The kernel is the central component of an operating system that manages the computer and its hardware operations. It handles memory operations and CPU time.</p>
    <p>The kernel acts as a bridge between applications and the hardware-level data processing using inter-process communication and system calls.</p>
    <p>The kernel loads into memory first when an operating system starts and remains there until the system shuts down. It is responsible for tasks like disk management, task management, and memory management.</p>
    <p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1719844849011/f4bb226e-f319-4cb5-bfc9-c1a80401123e.png" alt="Linux Kernel Layout showing interaction of kernal with applications and OS" class="image--center mx-auto" width="563" height="393" loading="lazy"></p>
    <p>If you are curious about what the Linux kernel looks like, <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux">here</a> is the GitHub link.</p>
    <h4 id="heading-what-is-a-linux-distribution">What is a Linux distribution?</h4>
    <p>By this point, you know that you can re-use the Linux kernel code, modify it, and create a new kernel. You can further combine different utilities and software to create a completely new operating system.</p>
    <p>A Linux distribution or distro is a version of the Linux operating system that includes the Linux kernel, system utilities, and other software. Being open source, a Linux distribution is a collaborative effort involving multiple independent open-source development communities.</p>
    <p><strong>What does it mean that a distribution is derived?</strong> When you say that a distribution is "derived" from another, the newer distro is built upon the base or foundation of the original distro. This derivation can include using the same package management system (more on this later), kernel version, and sometimes the same configuration tools.</p>
    <p>Today, there are thousands of Linux distributions to choose from, offering differing goals and criteria for selecting and supporting the software provided by their distribution.</p>
    <p>Distributions vary from one to the other, but they generally have several common characteristics:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><p>A distribution consists of a Linux kernel.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>It supports user space programs.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>A distribution may be small and single-purpose or include thousands of open-source programs.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Some means of installing and updating the distribution and its components should be provided.</p>
    </li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you view the <a target="_blank" href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Linux_Distribution_Timeline.svg">Linux Distributions Timeline</a>, you'll see two major distros: Slackware and Debian. Several distributions are derived from them. For example, Ubuntu and Kali are derived from Debian.</p>
    <p><strong>What are the advantages of derivation?</strong> There are various advantages of derivation. Derived distributions can leverage the stability, security, and large software repositories of the parent distribution.</p>
    <p>When building on an existing foundation, developers can drive their focus and effort entirely on the specialized features of the new distribution. Users of derived distributions can benefit from the documentation, community support, and resources already available for the parent distribution.</p>
    <p>Some popular Linux distributions are:</p>
    <ol>
    <li><p><strong>Ubuntu</strong>: One of the most widely used and popular Linux distributions. It is user-friendly and recommended for beginners. <a target="_blank" href="https://ubuntu.com/">Learn more about Ubuntu here</a>.</p>

    <h4 id="heading-how-to-install-and-access-linux">How to install and access Linux</h4>
    <p>The best way to learn is to apply the concepts as you go. In this section, we'll learn how to install Linux on your machine so you can follow along. You'll also learn how to access Linux on a Windows machine.</p>
    <p>I recommend that you follow any one of the methods mentioned in this section to get access to Linux so you may follow along.</p>
    <h5 id="heading-install-linux-as-the-primary-os">Install Linux as the primary OS</h5>
    <p>Installing Linux as the primary OS is the most efficient way to use Linux, as you can use the full power of your machine.</p>
    <p>In this section, you will learn how to install Ubuntu, which is one of the most popular Linux distributions. I have left out other distributions for now, as I want to keep things simple. You can always explore other distributions once you are comfortable with Ubuntu.</p>
    <ul>
    <li><p><strong>Step 1 – Download the Ubuntu iso:</strong> Go to the official <a target="_blank" href="https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop">website</a> and download the iso file. Make sure to select a stable release that is labeled "LTS". LTS stands for Long Term Support which means you can get free security and maintenance updates for a long time (usually 5 years).</p>
    </li>
    <li><p><strong>Step 2 – Create a bootable pendrive:</strong> There are a number of softwares that can create a bootable pendrive. I recommend using Rufus, as it is quite easy to use. You can download it from <a target="_blank" href="https://rufus.ie/">here</a>.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p><strong>Step 3 – Boot from the pendrive:</strong> Once your bootable pendrive is ready, insert it and boot from the pendrive. The boot menu depends on your laptop. You can google the boot menu for your laptop model.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p><strong>Step 4 – Follow the prompts.</strong> Once, the boot process starts, select <code>try or install ubuntu</code>.</p>
    <p>  <img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1719304227675/5b706f94-7368-47ca-a4d6-d55a0d92eff9.png" alt="Screen prompt to either try or install Ubuntu" class="image--center mx-auto" width="611" height="329" loading="lazy"></p>
    <p>  The process will take some time. Once the GUI appears, you can select the language, and keyboard layout and continue. Enter your login and name. Remember the credentials as you will need them to log in to your system and access full privileges. Wait for the installation to complete.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p><strong>Step 5 – Restart:</strong> Click on restart now and remove the pen drive.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p><strong>Step 6 – Login:</strong> Login with the credentials you entered earlier.</p>
    </li>
    </ul>
    <p>And there you go! Now you can install apps and customize your desktop.</p>
    <p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1719304547967/d150c6eb-d04e-47e0-8473-d1a837df45c4.png" alt="Ubuntu 22.04.4 LTS Desktop screen" class="image--center mx-auto" width="1920" height="1080" loading="lazy"></p>
    <p>For advanced installation, you can explore the following topics:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><p>Disk partitioning.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Setting swap memory for enabling hibernation.</p>
    </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Accessing the terminal</strong></p>
    <p>An important part of this handbook is learning about the terminal where you'll run all the commands and see the magic happen. You can search for the terminal by pressing the "windows" key and typing "terminal". You can pin the Terminal in the dock where other apps are located for easy access.</p>
    <p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1719305113272/4dd30c5e-da73-4cd4-86bb-7dcd8cd2084c.png" alt="Search results for &quot;terminal&quot;" class="image--center mx-auto" width="437" height="255" loading="lazy"></p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>💡 The shortcut for opening the terminal is <code>ctrl+alt+t</code></p>

    <h5 id="heading-how-to-use-linux-on-a-windows-machine">How to use Linux on a Windows machine</h5>
    <p>Sometimes you might need to run both Linux and Windows side by side. Luckily, there are some ways you can get the best of both worlds without getting different computers for each operating system.</p>
    <p>In this section, you'll explore a few ways to use Linux on a Windows machine. Some of them are browser-based or cloud-based and do not need any OS installation before using them.</p>
    <p><strong>Option 1: "Dual-boot" Linux + Windows</strong> With dual boot, you can install Linux alongside Windows on your computer, allowing you to choose which operating system to use at startup.</p>
    <p>This requires partitioning your hard drive and installing Linux on a separate partition. With this approach, you can only use one operating system at a time.</p>
    <p><strong>Option 2: Use Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)</strong> Windows Subsystem for Linux provides a compatibility layer that lets you run Linux binary executables natively on Windows.</p>
    <p>Using WSL has some advantages. The setup for WSL is simple and not time-consuming. It is lightweight compared to VMs where you have to allocate resources from the host machine. You don't need to install any ISO or virtual disc image for Linux machines which tend to be heavy files. You can use Windows and Linux side by side.</p>
    <p><strong>How to install WSL2</strong></p>
    <p>First, enable the Windows Subsystem for Linux option in settings.</p>
    <ul>
    <li><p>Go to Start. Search for "Turn Windows features on or off."</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Check the option "Windows Subsystem for Linux" if it isn't already.</p>
    <p>  <img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1719306102095/84f23bae-faa5-4ece-a9b6-e40f8789a061.png" alt="Checking the option &quot;Windows Subsystem for Linux&quot; in Windows features" class="image--center mx-auto" width="891" height="550" loading="lazy"></p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Next, open your command prompt and provide the installation commands.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Open Command Prompt as an administrator:</p>
    <p>  <img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1720451480640/6052c9b4-cf07-47e0-ae89-18c3a2d3e385.png" alt="Running command prompt as an admin by right clicking the app and choosing &quot;run as admin£" class="image--center mx-auto" width="1032" height="846" loading="lazy"></p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Run the command below:</p>
    </li>
    </ul>
    <pre class="language-markdown" tabindex="0"><code class="language-markdown">wsl --install
    </code></pre>
    <p>This is the output:</p>

    <p>Note: By default, Ubuntu will be installed.</p>
    <p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1719306144861/a01f95df-1d95-4b79-bff9-08759be0d3dc.png" alt="Ubuntu installed by default using WSL" class="image--center mx-auto" width="1092" height="626" loading="lazy"></p>
    <ul>
    <li>Once installation is complete, you'll need to reboot your Windows machine. So, restart your Windows machine.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>After restarting, you might see a window like this:</p>
    <p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1719306157704/15620fbe-59d1-40da-9cd6-119a1fab0802.png" alt="Window that shows after a restart" class="image--center mx-auto" width="1111" height="647" loading="lazy"></p>
    <p>Once installation of Ubuntu is complete, you'll be prompted to enter your username and password.</p>

    <p><strong>Option 3: Use a Virtual Machine (VM)</strong></p>
    <p>A virtual machine (VM) is a software emulation of a physical computer system. It allows you to run multiple operating systems and applications on a single physical machine simultaneously.</p>
    <p>You can use virtualization software such as Oracle VirtualBox or VMware to create a virtual machine running Linux within your Windows environment. This allows you to run Linux as a guest operating system alongside Windows.</p>
    <p>VM software provides options to allocate and manage hardware resources for each VM, including CPU cores, memory, disk space, and network bandwidth. You can adjust these allocations based on the requirements of the guest operating systems and applications.</p>
    <p>Here are some of the common options available for virtualization:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">Oracle virtual box</a></p>
    </li>
    <li><p><a target="_blank" href="https://multipass.run/">Multipass</a></p>
    </li>
    <li><p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.vmware.com/content/vmware/vmware-published-sites/us/products/workstation-player.html.html">VMware workstation player</a></p>
    </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Option 4: Use a Browser-based Solution</strong></p>
    <p>Browser-based solutions are particularly useful for quick testing, learning, or accessing Linux environments from devices that don't have Linux installed.</p>
    <p>You can either use online code editors or web-based terminals to access Linux. Note that you usually don't have full administration privileges in these cases.</p>
    <h4 id="heading-online-code-editors"><strong>Online code editors</strong></h4>
    <p>Online code editors offer editors with built-in Linux terminals. While their primary purpose is coding, you can also utilize the Linux terminal to execute commands and perform tasks.</p>
    <p><a target="_blank" href="https://replit.com/">Replit</a> is an example of an online code editor, where you can write your code and access the Linux shell at the same time.</p>
    <p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1719306257260/d85d5541-b78f-4c8b-99a8-dbd8c097f661.gif" alt="Running scripts and a bash shell in Replit" class="image--center mx-auto" width="1520" height="721" loading="lazy"></p>
    <h4 id="heading-web-based-linux-terminals"><strong>Web-based Linux terminals:</strong></h4>
    <p>Online Linux terminals allow you to access a Linux command-line interface directly from your browser. These terminals provide a web-based interface to a Linux shell, enabling you to execute commands and work with Linux utilities.</p>
    <p>One such example is <a target="_blank" href="https://jslinux.org/">JSLinux</a>. The screenshot below shows a ready-to-use Linux environment:</p>
    <p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1719306276915/ddaabfc3-9a20-43b2-bedc-0af6875d2008.png" alt="Using JSLinux to access Linux terminal" class="image--center mx-auto" width="826" height="765" loading="lazy"></p>
    <p><strong>Option 5: Use a Cloud-based Solution</strong></p>
    <p>Instead of running Linux directly on your Windows machine, you can consider using cloud-based Linux environments or virtual private servers (VPS) to access and work with Linux remotely.</p>
    <p>Services like Amazon EC2, Microsoft Azure, or DigitalOcean provide Linux instances that you can connect to from your Windows computer. Note that some of these services offer free tiers, but they are not usually free in the long run.</p>

    <h3 id="heading-21-getting-started-with-the-bash-shell">2.1. Getting Started with the Bash shell</h3>
    <h4 id="heading-introduction-to-the-bash-shell">Introduction to the bash shell</h4>
    <p>The Linux command line is provided by a program called the shell. Over the years, the shell program has evolved to cater to various options.</p>
    <p>Different users can be configured to use different shells. But, most users prefer to stick with the current default shell. The default shell for many Linux distros is the GNU Bourne-Again Shell (<code>bash</code>). Bash is succeeded by the Bourne shell (<code>sh</code>).</p>
    <p>To find out your current shell, open your terminal and enter the following command:</p>
    <pre class="language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token builtin class-name">echo</span> <span class="token environment constant">$SHELL</span>
    </code></pre>
    <p>Command breakdown:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><p>The <code>echo</code> command is used to print on the terminal.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>The <code>$SHELL</code> is a special variable that holds the name of the current shell.</p>
    </li>
    </ul>
    <p>In my setup, the output is <code>/bin/bash</code>. This means that I am using the bash shell.</p>
    <pre class="language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token comment"># output</span>
    <span class="token builtin class-name">echo</span> <span class="token environment constant">$SHELL</span>
    /bin/bash
    </code></pre>
    <p>Bash is very powerful as it can simplify certain operations that are hard to accomplish efficiently with a GUI (or Graphical User Interface). Remember that most servers do not have a GUI, and it is best to learn to use the powers of a command line interface (CLI).</p>
    <p><strong>Terminal vs Shell</strong></p>
    <p>The terms "terminal" and "shell" are often used interchangeably, but they refer to different parts of the command-line interface.</p>
    <p>The terminal is the interface you use to interact with the shell. The shell is the command interpreter that processes and executes your commands. You'll learn more about shells in Part 6 of the handbook.</p>
    <h4 id="heading-what-is-a-prompt">What is a prompt?</h4>
    <p>When a shell is used interactively, it displays a <code>$</code> when it is waiting for a command from the user. This is called the shell prompt.</p>
    <p><code>[username@host ~]$</code></p>
    <p>If the shell is running as <code>root</code> (you'll learn more about the root user later on), the prompt is changed to <code>#</code>.</p>
    <p><code>[root@host ~]#</code></p>
    <h3 id="heading-22-command-structure">2.2. Command Structure</h3>
    <p>A command is a program that performs a specific operation. Once you have access to the shell, you can enter any command after the <code>$</code> sign and see the output on the terminal.</p>
    <p>Generally, Linux commands follow this syntax:</p>
    <pre class="language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token builtin class-name">command</span> <span class="token punctuation">[</span>options<span class="token punctuation">]</span> <span class="token punctuation">[</span>arguments<span class="token punctuation">]</span>
    </code></pre>
    <p>Here is the breakdown of the above syntax:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><p><code>command</code>: This is the name of the command you want to execute. <code>ls</code> (list), <code>cp</code> (copy), and <code>rm</code> (remove) are common Linux commands.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p><code>[options]</code>: Options, or flags, often preceded by a hyphen (-) or double hyphen (--), modify the behavior of the command. They can change how the command operates. For example, <code>ls -a</code> uses the <code>-a</code> option to display hidden files in the current directory.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p><code>[arguments]</code>: Arguments are the inputs for the commands that require one. These could be filenames, user names, or other data that the command will act upon. For example, in the command <code>cat access.log</code>, <code>cat</code> is the command and <code>access.log</code> is the input. As a result, the <code>cat</code> command displays the contents of the <code>access.log</code> file.</p>
    </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Options and arguments are not required for all commands. Some commands can be run without any options or arguments, while others might require one or both to function correctly. You can always refer to the command's manual to check the options and arguments it supports.</p>
    <p>💡<strong>Tip:</strong> You can view a command's manual using the <code>man</code> command.</p>
    <p>You can access the manual page for <code>ls</code> with <code>man ls</code>, and it'll look like this:</p>
    <p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1719312523336/5b1232a6-8c0b-4a97-86f0-9f15f2e14ed7.png" alt="5b1232a6-8c0b-4a97-86f0-9f15f2e14ed7" class="image--center mx-auto" width="1890" height="969" loading="lazy"></p>
    <p>Manual pages are a great and quick way to access the documentation. I highly recommend going through man pages for the commands that you use the most.</p>
    <h3 id="heading-23-bash-commands-and-keyboard-shortcuts">2.3. Bash Commands and Keyboard Shortcuts</h3>
    <p>When you are in the terminal, you can speed up your tasks by using shortcuts.</p>
    <p>Here are some of the most common terminal shortcuts:</p>
    <div class="hn-table">
    <table>

    <h3 id="heading-41-the-linux-file-system-hierarchy">4.1. The Linux File-system Hierarchy</h3>
    <p>All files in Linux are stored in a file-system. It follows an inverted-tree-like structure because the root is at the topmost part.</p>
    <p>The <code>/</code> is the root directory and the starting point of the file system. The root directory contains all other directories and files on the system. The <code>/</code> character also serves as a directory separator between path names. For example, <code>/home/alice</code> forms a complete path.</p>
    <p>The image below shows the complete file system hierarchy. Each directory servers a specific purpose.</p>

    <h4 id="heading-locating-your-current-directory-using-the-pwd-command">Locating your current directory using the <code>pwd</code> command</h4>
    <p>It is easy to lose your way in the Linux file system, especially if you are new to the command line. You can locate your current directory using the <code>pwd</code> command.</p>
    <p>Here is an example:</p>
    <pre class="language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token builtin class-name">pwd</span>

    <h4 id="heading-changing-directories-using-the-cd-command">Changing directories using the <code>cd</code> command</h4>
    <p>The command to change directories is <code>cd</code> and it stands for "change directory". You can use the <code>cd</code> command to navigate to a different directory.</p>
    <p>You can use a relative path or an absolute path.</p>
    <p>For example, if you want to navigate the below file structure (following the red lines):</p>

    <p>Where,</p>
    <ul>
    <li><p><code>/path</code> is the path where the file is expected to be found. This is the starting point for searching files. The path can also be<code>/</code>or <code>.</code> which represents the root and current directory, respectively.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p><code>-type</code> represents the file descriptors. They can be any of the below:<br>  <code>f</code> – <strong>Regular file</strong> such as text files, images, and hidden files.<br>  <code>d</code> – <strong>Directory</strong>. These are the folders under consideration.<br>  <code>l</code> – <strong>Symbolic link</strong>. Symbolic links point to files and are similar to shortcuts.<br>  <code>c</code> – <strong>Character devices</strong>. Files that are used to access character devices are called character device files. Drivers communicate with character devices by sending and receiving single characters (bytes, octets). Examples include keyboards, sound cards, and the mouse.<br>  <code>b</code> – <strong>Block devices</strong>. Files that are used to access block devices are called block device files. Drivers communicate with block devices by sending and receiving entire blocks of data. Examples include USB and CD-ROM</p>
    </li>
    <li><p><code>-name</code> is the name of the file type that you want to search.</p>
    </li>
    </ul>
    <h4 id="heading-how-to-search-files-by-name-or-extension">How to search files by name or extension</h4>

    <h3 id="heading-45-basic-commands-for-viewing-files">4.5. Basic Commands for Viewing Files</h3>
    <h4 id="heading-concatenate-and-display-files-using-the-cat-command">Concatenate and display files using the <code>cat</code> command</h4>
    <p>The <code>cat</code> command in Linux is used to display the contents of a file. It can also be used to concatenate files and create new files.</p>
    <p>Here is the basic syntax of the <code>cat</code> command:</p>
    <pre class="language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token function">cat</span> <span class="token punctuation">[</span>options<span class="token punctuation">]</span> <span class="token punctuation">[</span>file<span class="token punctuation">]</span>
    </code></pre>
    <p>The simplest way to use <code>cat</code> is without any options or arguments. This will display the contents of the file on the terminal.</p>
    <p>For example, if you want to view the contents of a file named <code>file.txt</code>, you can use the following command:</p>
    <pre class="language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token function">cat</span> file.txt
    </code></pre>
    <p>This will display all the contents of the file on the terminal at once.</p>
    <h4 id="heading-viewing-text-files-interactively-using-less-and-more">Viewing text files interactively using <code>less</code> and <code>more</code></h4>
    <p>While <code>cat</code> displays the entire file at once, <code>less</code> and <code>more</code> allow you to view the contents of a file interactively. This is useful when you want to scroll through a large file or search for specific content.</p>
    <p>The syntax of the <code>less</code> command is:</p>
    <pre class="language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token function">less</span> <span class="token punctuation">[</span>options<span class="token punctuation">]</span> <span class="token punctuation">[</span>file<span class="token punctuation">]</span>
    </code></pre>
    <p>The <code>more</code> command is similar to <code>less</code> but has fewer features. It is used to display the contents of a file one screen at a time.</p>
    <p>The syntax of the <code>more</code> command is:</p>
    <pre class="language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token function">more</span> <span class="token punctuation">[</span>options<span class="token punctuation">]</span> <span class="token punctuation">[</span>file<span class="token punctuation">]</span>
    </code></pre>
    <p>For both commands, you can use the <code>spacebar</code> to scroll one page down, the <code>Enter</code> key to scroll one line down, and the <code>q</code> key to exit the viewer.</p>
    <p>To move backward you can use the <code>b</code> key, and to move forward you can use the <code>f</code> key.</p>
    <h4 id="heading-displaying-the-last-part-of-files-using-tail">Displaying the last part of files using <code>tail</code></h4>
    <p>Sometimes you might need to view just the last few lines of a file instead of the entire file. The <code>tail</code> command in Linux is used to display the last part of a file.</p>
    <p>For example, <code>tail file.txt</code> will display the last 10 lines of the file <code>file.txt</code> by default.</p>
    <p>If you want to display a different number of lines, you can use the <code>-n</code> option followed by the number of lines you want to display.</p>
    <pre class="language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token comment"># Display the last 50 lines of the file file.txt</span>
    <span class="token function">tail</span> <span class="token parameter variable">-n</span> <span class="token number">50</span> file.txt
    </code></pre>
    <p>💡<strong>Tip:</strong> Another usage of the <code>tail</code> is its follow-along (<code>-f</code>) option. This option enables you to view the contents of a file as they are being written. This is a useful utility for viewing and monitoring log files in real-time.</p>
    <h4 id="heading-displaying-the-beginning-of-files-using-head">Displaying the beginning of files using <code>head</code></h4>
    <p>Just like <code>tail</code> displays the last part of a file, you can use the <code>head</code> command in Linux to display the beginning of a file.</p>
    <p>For example, <code>head file.txt</code> will display the first 10 lines of the file <code>file.txt</code> by default.</p>
    <p>To change the number of lines displayed, you can use the <code>-n</code> option followed by the number of lines you want to display.</p>
    <h4 id="heading-counting-words-lines-and-characters-using-wc">Counting words, lines, and characters using <code>wc</code></h4>
    <p>You can count words, lines and characters in a file using the <code>wc</code> command.</p>
    <p>For example, running <code>wc syslog.log</code> gave me the following output:</p>
    <pre class="language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token number">1669</span> <span class="token number">9623</span> <span class="token number">64367</span> syslog.log
    </code></pre>
    <p>In the output above,</p>
    <ul>
    <li><p><code>1669</code> represents the number of lines in the file <code>syslog.log</code>.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p><code>9623</code> represents the number of words in the file <code>syslog.log</code>.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p><code>64367</code> represents the number of characters in the file <code>syslog.log</code>.</p>
    </li>
    </ul>
    <p>So, the command <code>wc syslog.log</code> counted <code>1669</code> lines, <code>9623</code> words, and <code>64367</code> characters in the file <code>syslog.log</code>.</p>
    <h4 id="heading-comparing-files-line-by-line-using-diff">Comparing files line by line using <code>diff</code></h4>
    <p>Comparing and finding differences between two files is a common task in Linux. You can compare two files right within the command line using the <code>diff</code> command.</p>
    <p>The basic syntax of the <code>diff</code> command is:</p>
    <pre class="language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token function">diff</span> <span class="token punctuation">[</span>options<span class="token punctuation">]</span> file1 file2
    </code></pre>
    <p>Here are two files, <code>hello.py</code> and <code>also-hello.py</code>, that we will compare using the <code>diff</code> command:</p>

    <h2 id="heading-part-5-the-essentials-of-text-editing-in-linux">Part 5: The Essentials of Text Editing in Linux</h2>
    <p>Text editing skills using the command line are one of the most crucial skills in Linux. In this section, you will learn how to use two popular text editors in Linux: Vim and Nano.</p>
    <p>I suggest that you master any one text editor of your choice and stick to it. It will save you time and make you more productive. Vim and nano are safe choices as they are present on most Linux distributions.</p>
    <h3 id="heading-51-mastering-vim-the-complete-guide">5.1. Mastering Vim: The Complete Guide</h3>
    <h4 id="heading-introduction-to-vim">Introduction to Vim</h4>
    <p>Vim is a popular text editing tool for the command line. Vim comes with its advantages: it is powerful, customizable, and fast. Here are some reasons why you should consider learning Vim:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><p>Most servers are accessed via a CLI, so in system administration, you don't necessarily have the luxury of a GUI. But Vim has got your back – it'll always be there.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Vim uses a keyboard-centric approach, as it is designed to be used without a mouse, which can significantly speed up editing tasks once you have learned the keyboard shortcuts. This also makes it faster than GUI tools.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Some Linux utilities, for example editing cron jobs, work in the same editing format as Vim.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Vim is suitable for all – beginners and advanced users. Vim supports complex string searches, highlighting searches, and much more. Through plugins, Vim provides extended capabilities to developers and system admins that includes code completion, syntax highlighting, file management, version control, and more.</p>
    </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Vim has two variations: Vim (<code>vim</code>) and Vim tiny (<code>vi</code>). Vim tiny is a smaller version of Vim that lacks some features of Vim.</p>
    <h4 id="heading-how-to-start-using-vim">How to start using <code>vim</code></h4>
    <p>Start using Vim with this command:</p>
    <pre class="language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token function">vim</span> your-file.txt
    </code></pre>
    <p><code>your-file.txt</code> can either be a new file or an existing file that you want to edit.</p>
    <h4 id="heading-navigating-vim-mastering-movement-and-command-modes">Navigating Vim: Mastering movement and command modes</h4>
    <p>In the early days of the CLI, the keyboards didn't have arrow keys. Hence, navigation was done using the set of available keys, <code>hjkl</code> being one of them.</p>
    <p>Being keyboard-centric, using <code>hjkl</code> keys can greatly speed up text editing tasks.</p>
    <p>Note: Although arrow keys would work totally fine, you can still experiment with <code>hjkl</code> keys to navigate. Some people find this this way of navigation efficient.</p>
    <p>💡<strong>Tip:</strong> To remember the <code>hjkl</code> sequence, use this: <strong>h</strong>ang back, <strong>j</strong>ump down, <strong>k</strong>ick up, <strong>l</strong>eap forward.</p>
    <p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1719392462442/1a667ede-5f03-4acb-b40f-b10cefc64de3.png" alt="hjkl navigation guide" class="image--center mx-auto" width="471" height="274" loading="lazy"></p>
    <h4 id="heading-the-three-vim-modes">The three Vim modes</h4>
    <p>You need to know the 3 operating modes of Vim and how to switch between them. Keystrokes behave differently in each command mode. The three modes are as follows:</p>
    <ol>
    <li><p>Command mode.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Edit mode.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Visual mode.</p>
    </li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Command Mode.</strong> When you start Vim, you land in the command mode by default. This mode allows you to access other modes.</p>
    <p>⚠ To switch to other modes, you need to be present in the command mode first</p>
    <p><strong>Edit Mode</strong></p>
    <p>This mode allows you to make changes to the file. To enter edit mode, press <code>I</code> while in command mode. Note the <code>'-- INSERT'</code> switch at the end of the screen.</p>
    <p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1719392526710/d44cecd7-64be-4c89-9a31-dbf395b77fcb.png" alt="Insert mode in Vim" class="image--center mx-auto" width="433" height="345" loading="lazy"></p>
    <p><strong>Visual mode</strong></p>
    <p>This mode allows you to work on a single character, a block of text, or lines of text. Let's break it down into simple steps. Remember, use the below combinations when in command mode.</p>
    <ul>
    <li><p><code>Shift + V</code> → Select multiple lines.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p><code>Ctrl + V</code> → Block mode</p>
    </li>
    <li><p><code>V</code> → Character mode</p>
    </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The visual mode comes in handy when you need to copy and paste or edit lines in bulk.</p>
    <p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1719392557097/b61a1515-cac0-4470-856b-b2c15de581e8.gif" alt="Selectind text using visual mode" class="image--center mx-auto" width="673" height="422" loading="lazy"></p>
    <p><strong>Extended command mode.</strong></p>
    <p>The extended command mode allows you to perform advanced operations like searching, setting line numbers, and highlighting text. We'll cover extended mode in the next section.</p>
    <p>How to stay on track? If you forget your current mode, just press <code>ESC</code> twice and you will be back in Command Mode.</p>
    <h4 id="heading-editing-efficiently-in-vim-copypasting-and-searching">Editing Efficiently in Vim: Copy/pasting and searching</h4>
    <p><strong>1. How to copy and paste in Vim</strong></p>
    <p>Copy-paste is known as 'yank' and 'put' in Linux terms. To copy-paste, follow these steps:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><p>Select text in visual mode.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Press <code>'y'</code> to copy/ yank.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Move your cursor to the required position and press <code>'p'</code>.</p>
    </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>2. How to search for text in Vim</strong></p>
    <p>Any series of strings can be searched with Vim using the <code>/</code> in command mode. To search, use <code>/string-to-match</code>.</p>
    <p>In the command mode, type <code>:set hls</code> and press <code>enter</code>. Search using <code>/string-to-match</code>. This will highlight the searches.</p>
    <p>Let's search a few strings:</p>
    <p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1719392684097/11c4a45e-0698-4fb7-bef7-f193684ea21a.gif" alt="Highlighting searches in Vim" class="image--center mx-auto" width="800" height="409" loading="lazy"></p>
    <p><strong>3. How to exit Vim</strong></p>
    <p>First, move to command mode (by pressing escape twice) and then use these flags:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><p>Exit without saving → <code>:q!</code></p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Exit and save → <code>:wq!</code></p>
    </li>
    </ul>

    <li><p><strong>Automation</strong>: Shell scripts allow you to automate repetitive tasks and processes, saving time and reducing the risk of errors that can occur with manual execution.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p><strong>Portability</strong>: Shell scripts can be run on various platforms and operating systems, including Unix, Linux, macOS, and even Windows through the use of emulators or virtual machines.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p><strong>Flexibility</strong>: Shell scripts are highly customizable and can be easily modified to suit specific requirements. They can also be combined with other programming languages or utilities to create more powerful scripts.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p><strong>Accessibility</strong>: Shell scripts are easy to write and don't require any special tools or software. They can be edited using any text editor, and most operating systems have a built-in shell interpreter.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p><strong>Integration</strong>: Shell scripts can be integrated with other tools and applications, such as databases, web servers, and cloud services, allowing for more complex automation and system management tasks.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p><strong>Debugging</strong>: Shell scripts are easy to debug, and most shells have built-in debugging and error-reporting tools that can help identify and fix issues quickly.</p>
    </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="heading-63-overview-of-bash-shell-and-command-line-interface">6.3. Overview of Bash Shell and Command Line Interface</h3>
    <p>The terms "shell" and "bash" are often used interchangeably. But there is a subtle difference between the two.</p>
    <p>The term "shell" refers to a program that provides a command-line interface for interacting with an operating system. Bash (Bourne-Again SHell) is one of the most commonly used Unix/Linux shells and is the default shell in many Linux distributions.</p>
    <p>Till now, the commands that you have been entering were basically being entered in a "shell".</p>
    <p>Although Bash is a type of shell, there are other shells available as well, such as Korn shell (ksh), C shell (csh), and Z shell (zsh). Each shell has its own syntax and set of features, but they all share the common purpose of providing a command-line interface for interacting with the operating system.</p>
    <p>You can determine your shell type using the <code>ps</code> command:</p>
    <pre class="language-markdown" tabindex="0"><code class="language-markdown">ps
    <span class="token title important"><span class="token punctuation">#</span> output:</span>
    
    <span class="token code keyword">    PID TTY          TIME CMD</span>
      20506 pts/0    00:00:00 bash &lt;--- the shell type
      20931 pts/0    00:00:00 ps
    </code></pre>
    <p>In summary, while "shell" is a broad term that refers to any program that provides a command-line interface, "Bash" is a specific type of shell that is widely used in Unix/Linux systems.</p>
    <p>Note: In this section, we will be using the "bash" shell.</p>
    <h3 id="heading-64-how-to-create-and-execute-bash-scripts">6.4. How to Create and Execute Bash scripts</h3>
    <p><strong>Script naming conventions</strong></p>
    <p>By naming convention, bash scripts end with <code>.sh</code>. However, bash scripts can run perfectly fine without the <code>sh</code> extension.</p>
    <p><strong>Adding the Shebang</strong></p>
    <p>Bash scripts start with a <code>shebang</code>. Shebang is a combination of <code>bash #</code> and <code>bang !</code> followed by the bash shell path. This is the first line of the script. Shebang tells the shell to execute it via bash shell. Shebang is simply an absolute path to the bash interpreter.</p>
    <p>Below is an example of the shebang statement.</p>
    <pre class="language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token shebang important">#!/bin/bash</span>
    </code></pre>
    <p>You can find your bash shell path (which may vary from the above) using the command:</p>
    <pre class="language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token function">which</span> <span class="token function">bash</span>
    </code></pre>
    <p><strong>Creating your first bash script</strong></p>
    <p>Our first script prompts the user to enter a path. In return, its contents will be listed.</p>
    <p>Create a file named <code>run_all.sh</code> using any editor of your choice.</p>
    <pre class="language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token function">vim</span> run_all.sh
    </code></pre>
    <p>Add the following commands in your file and save it:</p>
    <pre class="language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token shebang important">#!/bin/bash</span>
    <span class="token builtin class-name">echo</span> <span class="token string">"Today is "</span> <span class="token variable"><span class="token variable">`</span><span class="token function">date</span><span class="token variable">`</span></span>

    </code></pre>
    <p>Let's take a deeper look at the script line by line. I am displaying the same script again, but this time with line numbers.</p>

      <span class="token number">8</span> <span class="token function">ls</span> <span class="token variable">$the_path</span>
    </code></pre>
    <ul>
    <li><p>Line #1: The shebang (<code>#!/bin/bash</code>) points toward the bash shell path.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Line #2: The <code>echo</code> command displays the current date and time on the terminal. Note that the <code>date</code> is in backticks.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Line #4: We want the user to enter a valid path.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Line #5: The <code>read</code> command reads the input and stores it in the variable <code>the_path</code>.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>line #8: The <code>ls</code> command takes the variable with the stored path and displays the current files and folders.</p>
    </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Executing the bash script</strong></p>
    <p>To make the script executable, assign execution rights to your user using this command:</p>
    <pre class="language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token function">chmod</span> u+x run_all.sh
    </code></pre>
    <p>Here,</p>
    <ul>
    <li><p><code>chmod</code> modifies the ownership of a file for the current user :<code>u</code>.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p><code>+x</code> adds the execution rights to the current user. This means that the user who is the owner can now run the script.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p><code>run_all.sh</code> is the file we wish to run.</p>
    </li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can run the script using any of the mentioned methods:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><p><code>sh run_all.sh</code></p>
    </li>
    <li><p><code>bash run_all.sh</code></p>
    </li>
    <li><p><code>./run_all.sh</code></p>
    </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Let's see it running in action 🚀</p>

    <h3 id="heading-65-bash-scripting-basics">6.5. Bash Scripting Basics</h3>
    <h4 id="heading-comments-in-bash-scripting">Comments in bash scripting</h4>
    <p>Comments start with a <code>#</code> in bash scripting. This means that any line that begins with a <code>#</code> is a comment and will be ignored by the interpreter.</p>
    <p>Comments are very helpful in documenting the code, and it is a good practice to add them to help others understand the code.</p>
    <p>These are examples of comments:</p>
    <pre class="language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token comment"># This is an example comment</span>
    <span class="token comment"># Both of these lines will be ignored by the interpreter</span>
    </code></pre>
    <h4 id="heading-variables-and-data-types-in-bash">Variables and data types in Bash</h4>
    <p>Variables let you store data. You can use variables to read, access, and manipulate data throughout your script.</p>
    <p>There are no data types in Bash. In Bash, a variable is capable of storing numeric values, individual characters, or strings of characters.</p>
    <p>In Bash, you can use and set the variable values in the following ways:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Assign the value directly:</li>
    </ol>
    <pre class="language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token assign-left variable">country</span><span class="token operator">=</span>Netherlands
    </code></pre>
    <p>2.  Assign the value based on the output obtained from a program or command, using command substitution. Note that <code>$</code> is required to access an existing variable's value.</p>
    <pre class="language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token assign-left variable">same_country</span><span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token variable">$country</span>
    </code></pre>
    <p>This assigns the value of <code>country</code> to the new variable <code>same_country</code>.</p>
    <p>To access the variable value, append <code>$</code> to the variable name.</p>
    <pre class="language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token assign-left variable">country</span><span class="token operator">=</span>Netherlands
    <span class="token builtin class-name">echo</span> <span class="token variable">$country</span>
    <span class="token comment"># output</span>
    Netherlands
    <span class="token assign-left variable">new_country</span><span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token variable">$country</span>
    <span class="token builtin class-name">echo</span> <span class="token variable">$new_country</span>
    <span class="token comment"># output</span>
    Netherlands
    </code></pre>
    <p>Above, you can see an example of assigning and printing variable values.</p>
    <h4 id="heading-variable-naming-conventions">Variable naming conventions</h4>
    <p>In Bash scripting, the following are the variable naming conventions:</p>
    <ol>
    <li><p>Variable names should start with a letter or an underscore (<code>_</code>).</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Variable names can contain letters, numbers, and underscores (<code>_</code>).</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Variable names are case-sensitive.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Variable names should not contain spaces or special characters.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Use descriptive names that reflect the purpose of the variable.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Avoid using reserved keywords, such as <code>if</code>, <code>then</code>, <code>else</code>, <code>fi</code>, and so on as variable names.</p>
    </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Here are some examples of valid variable names in Bash:</p>
    <pre class="language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash">name
    count
    _var
    myVar
    MY_VAR
    </code></pre>
    <p>And here are some examples of invalid variable names:</p>
    <pre class="language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token comment"># invalid variable names</span>
    
    2ndvar <span class="token punctuation">(</span>variable name starts with a number<span class="token punctuation">)</span>
    my var <span class="token punctuation">(</span>variable name contains a space<span class="token punctuation">)</span>
    my-var <span class="token punctuation">(</span>variable name contains a hyphen<span class="token punctuation">)</span>
    </code></pre>
    <p>Following these naming conventions helps make Bash scripts more readable and easier to maintain.</p>
    <h4 id="heading-input-and-output-in-bash-scripts">Input and output in Bash scripts</h4>
    <h4 id="heading-gathering-input">Gathering input</h4>
    <p>In this section, we'll discuss some methods to provide input to our scripts.</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Reading the user input and storing it in a variable</li>
    </ol>
    <p>We can read the user input using the <code>read</code> command.</p>
    <pre class="language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token shebang important">#!/bin/bash</span>
    <span class="token builtin class-name">echo</span> <span class="token string">"What's your name?"</span>

    <p>2.  Reading from a file</p>
    <p>This code reads each line from a file named <code>input.txt</code> and prints it to the terminal. We'll study while loops later in this section.</p>
    <pre class="language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token keyword">while</span> <span class="token builtin class-name">read</span> line
    <span class="token keyword">do</span>

    <span class="token keyword">done</span> <span class="token operator">&lt;</span> input.txt
    </code></pre>
    <p>3.  Command line arguments</p>
    <p>In a bash script or function, <code>$1</code> denotes the initial argument passed, <code>$2</code> denotes the second argument passed, and so forth.</p>
    <p>This script takes a name as a command-line argument and prints a personalized greeting.</p>
    <pre class="language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token shebang important">#!/bin/bash</span>
    <span class="token builtin class-name">echo</span> <span class="token string">"Hello, <span class="token variable">$1</span>!"</span>
    </code></pre>
    <p>We have supplied <code>Zaira</code> as our argument to the script.</p>
    <p><strong>Output:</strong></p>
    <p><img src="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2023/03/name-sh-1.gif" alt="Providing arguments to the bash script" width="883" height="455" loading="lazy"></p>
    <h4 id="heading-displaying-output">Displaying output</h4>
    <p>Here we'll discuss some methods to receive output from the scripts.</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Printing to the terminal:</li>
    </ol>
    <pre class="language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token builtin class-name">echo</span> <span class="token string">"Hello, World!"</span>
    </code></pre>
    <p>This prints the text "Hello, World!" to the terminal.</p>
    <p>2.  Writing to a file:</p>
    <pre class="language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token builtin class-name">echo</span> <span class="token string">"This is some text."</span> <span class="token operator">&gt;</span> output.txt
    </code></pre>
    <p>This writes the text "This is some text." to a file named <code>output.txt</code>. Note that the <code>&gt;</code> operator overwrites a file if it already has some content.</p>
    <p>3.  Appending to a file:</p>
    <pre class="language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token builtin class-name">echo</span> <span class="token string">"More text."</span> <span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span> output.txt
    </code></pre>
    <p>This appends the text "More text." to the end of the file <code>output.txt</code>.</p>
    <p>4.  Redirecting output:</p>
    <pre class="language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token function">ls</span> <span class="token operator">&gt;</span> files.txt
    </code></pre>
    <p>This lists the files in the current directory and writes the output to a file named <code>files.txt</code>. You can redirect output of any command to a file this way.</p>
    <p>You'll learn about output redirection in detail in section 8.5.</p>
    <h4 id="heading-conditional-statements-ifelse">Conditional statements (if/else)</h4>
    <p>Expressions that produce a boolean result, either true or false, are called conditions. There are several ways to evaluate conditions, including <code>if</code>, <code>if-else</code>, <code>if-elif-else</code>, and nested conditionals.</p>
    <p><strong>Syntax</strong>:</p>
    <pre class="language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token keyword">if</span> <span class="token punctuation">[</span><span class="token punctuation">[</span> condition <span class="token punctuation">]</span><span class="token punctuation">]</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>

    <span class="token keyword">else</span>
        <span class="token keyword">do</span> this by default
    <span class="token keyword">fi</span>
    </code></pre>
    <h4 id="heading-syntax-of-bash-conditional-statements">Syntax of bash conditional statements</h4>
    <p>We can use logical operators such as AND <code>-a</code> and OR <code>-o</code> to make comparisons that have more significance.</p>
    <pre class="language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token keyword">if</span> <span class="token punctuation">[</span> <span class="token variable">$a</span> <span class="token parameter variable">-gt</span> <span class="token number">60</span> <span class="token parameter variable">-a</span> <span class="token variable">$b</span> <span class="token parameter variable">-lt</span> <span class="token number">100</span> <span class="token punctuation">]</span>
    </code></pre>
    <p>This statement checks if both conditions are <code>true</code>: <code>a</code> is greater than <code>60</code> AND <code>b</code> is less than <code>100</code>.</p>
    <p>Let's see an example of a Bash script that uses <code>if</code>, <code>if-else</code>, and <code>if-elif-else</code> statements to determine if a user-inputted number is positive, negative, or zero:</p>
    <pre class="language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token shebang important">#!/bin/bash</span>

    <span class="token keyword">fi</span>
    </code></pre>
    <p>The script first prompts the user to enter a number. Then, it uses an <code>if</code> statement to check if the number is greater than <code>0</code>. If it is, the script outputs that the number is positive. If the number is not greater than <code>0</code>, the script moves on to the next statement, which is an <code>if-elif</code> statement.</p>
    <p>Here, the script checks if the number is less than <code>0</code>. If it is, the script outputs that the number is negative.</p>
    <p>Finally, if the number is neither greater than <code>0</code> nor less than <code>0</code>, the script uses an <code>else</code> statement to output that the number is zero.</p>

    <h4 id="heading-looping-and-branching-in-bash">Looping and branching in Bash</h4>
    <p><strong>While loop</strong></p>
    <p>While loops check for a condition and loop until the condition remains <code>true</code>. We need to provide a counter statement that increments the counter to control loop execution.</p>
    <p>In the example below, <code>(( i += 1 ))</code> is the counter statement that increments the value of <code>i</code>. The loop will run exactly 10 times.</p>

    <p><strong>For loop</strong></p>
    <p>The <code>for</code> loop, just like the <code>while</code> loop, allows you to execute statements a specific number of times. Each loop differs in its syntax and usage.</p>
    <p>In the example below, the loop will iterate 5 times.</p>

    <p><strong>Case statements</strong></p>
    <p>In Bash, case statements are used to compare a given value against a list of patterns and execute a block of code based on the first pattern that matches. The syntax for a case statement in Bash is as follows:</p>
    <pre class="language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token keyword">case</span> expression <span class="token keyword">in</span>

    <p>Here, "expression" is the value that we want to compare, and "pattern1", "pattern2", "pattern3", and so on are the patterns that we want to compare it against.</p>
    <p>The double semicolon ";;" separates each block of code to execute for each pattern. The asterisk "*" represents the default case, which executes if none of the specified patterns match the expression.</p>
    <p>Let's see an example:</p>

    </code></pre>
    <p>In this example, since the value of <code>fruit</code> is <code>apple</code>, the first pattern matches, and the block of code that echoes <code>This is a red fruit.</code> is executed. If the value of <code>fruit</code> were instead <code>banana</code>, the second pattern would match and the block of code that echoes <code>This is a yellow fruit.</code> would execute, and so on.</p>
    <p>If the value of <code>fruit</code> does not match any of the specified patterns, the default case is executed, which echoes <code>Unknown fruit.</code></p>
    <h2 id="heading-part-7-managing-software-packages-in-linux">Part 7: Managing Software Packages in Linux</h2>
    <p>Linux comes with several built-in programs. But you might need to install new programs based on your needs. You might also need to upgrade the existing applications.</p>
    <h3 id="heading-71-packages-and-package-management">7.1. Packages and Package Management</h3>
    <h4 id="heading-what-is-a-package">What is a package?</h4>
    <p>A package is a collection of files that are bundled together. These files are essential for a particular program to run. These files contain the program's executable files, libraries, and other resources.</p>
    <p>In addition to the files required for the program to run, packages also contain installation scripts, which copy the files to where they are needed. A program may contain many files and dependencies. With packages, it is easier to manage all the files and dependencies at once.</p>
    <h4 id="heading-what-is-the-difference-between-source-and-binary">What is the difference between source and binary?</h4>
    <p>Programmers write source code in a programming language. This source code is then compiled into machine code that the computer can understand. The compiled code is called binary code.</p>
    <p>When you download a package, you can either get the <em>source code</em> or the <em>binary code.</em> The source code is the human-readable code that can be compiled into binary code. The binary code is the compiled code that the computer can understand.</p>
    <p>Source packages can be used with any type of machine if the source code is compiled properly. Binary, on the other hand, is compiled code that is specific to a particular type of machine or architecture.</p>
    <p>You can find the architecture of your machine using the <code>uname -m</code> command.</p>
    <pre class="language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token function">uname</span> <span class="token parameter variable">-m</span>
    <span class="token comment"># output</span>
    x86_64
    </code></pre>
    <h4 id="heading-package-dependencies">Package dependencies</h4>
    <p>Programs often share files. Instead of including these files in each package, a separate package can provide them for all programs.</p>
    <p>To install a program that needs these files, you must also install the package containing them. This is called a package dependency. Specifying dependencies makes packages smaller and simpler by reducing duplicates.</p>
    <p>When you install a program, its dependencies must also be installed. Most required dependencies are usually already installed, but a few extra ones might be needed. So, don't be surprised if several other packages are installed along with your chosen package. These are the necessary dependencies.</p>
    <h4 id="heading-package-managers">Package managers</h4>
    <p>Linux offers a comprehensive package management system for installing, upgrading, configuring, and removing software.</p>
    <p>With package management, you can get access to an organized base of thousands of software packages along with having the ability to resolve dependencies and check for software updates.</p>
    <p>Packages can be managed using either command-line utilities that can be easily automated by system administrators, or through a graphical interface.</p>
    <h4 id="heading-software-channelsrepositories">Software channels/repositories</h4>
    <p>⚠️ Package management is different for different distros. Here, we are using Ubuntu.</p>
    <p>Installing software is a bit different in Linux as compared to Windows and Mac.</p>
    <p>Linux uses repositories to store software packages. A repository is a collection of software packages that are available for installation via a package manager.</p>
    <p>A package manager also stores an index of all of the packages available from a repo. Sometimes the index is rebuilt to ensure that it is up to date and to know which packages have been upgraded or added to the channel since it last checked.</p>
    <p>The generic process of downloading software from a repo looks something like this:</p>
    <p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1719313472889/f4961606-b9c4-4ed7-8edc-61e0fc6908e4.png" alt="Rrocess of downloading software from a remote repo" class="image--center mx-auto" width="1080" height="1080" loading="lazy"></p>
    <p>If we talk specifically about Ubuntu,</p>
    <ol>
    <li><p>Index is fetched using <code>apt update.</code> (<code>apt</code> is explained in next section).</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Required files/ dependencies requested according to index using <code>apt install</code></p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Packages and dependencies installed locally.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Update dependencies and packages when required using <code>apt update</code> and <code>apt upgrade</code></p>
    </li>
    </ol>
    <p>On Debian-based distros, you can file the list of repos (repositories) in <code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code>.</p>
    <h3 id="heading-72-installing-a-package-via-command-line">7.2. Installing a Package via Command Line</h3>
    <p>The <code>apt</code> command is a powerful command-line tool, which works with Ubuntu’s "Advanced Packaging Tool (APT)".</p>
    <p><code>apt</code>, along with the commands bundled with it, provides the means to install new software packages, upgrade existing software packages, update the package list index, and even upgrade the entire Ubuntu system.</p>
    <p>To view the logs of the installation using <code>apt</code>, you can view the <code>/var/log/dpkg.log</code> file.</p>
    <p>Following are the uses of the <code>apt</code> command:</p>
    <h4 id="heading-installing-packages">Installing packages</h4>
    <p>For example, to install the <code>htop</code> package, you can use the following command:</p>
    <pre class="language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token function">sudo</span> <span class="token function">apt</span> <span class="token function">install</span> <span class="token function">htop</span>
    </code></pre>
    <h4 id="heading-updating-the-package-list-index">Updating the package list index</h4>
    <p>The package list index is a list of all the packages available in the repositories. To update the local package list index, you can use the following command:</p>
    <pre class="language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token function">sudo</span> <span class="token function">apt</span> update
    </code></pre>
    <h4 id="heading-upgrading-the-packages">Upgrading the packages</h4>
    <p>Installed packages on your system can get updates containing bug fixes, security patches, and new features.</p>
    <p>To upgrade the packages, you can use the following command:</p>
    <pre class="language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token function">sudo</span> <span class="token function">apt</span> upgrade
    </code></pre>
    <h4 id="heading-removing-packages">Removing packages</h4>
    <p>To remove a package, like <code>htop</code>, you can use the following command:</p>
    <pre class="language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token function">sudo</span> <span class="token function">apt</span> remove <span class="token function">htop</span>

    <h3 id="heading-73-installing-a-package-via-an-advanced-graphical-method-synaptic">7.3. Installing a Package via an Advanced Graphical Method – Synaptic</h3>
    <p>If you are not comfortable with the command line, you can use a GUI application to install packages. You can achieve the same results as the command line, but with a graphical interface.</p>
    <p>Synaptic is a GUI package management application that helps in listing the installed packages, their status, pending updates, and so on. It offers custom filters to help you narrow down the search results.</p>
    <p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1719313599636/0f362ed7-c371-4a58-96c2-c359178cdbd9.png" alt="0f362ed7-c371-4a58-96c2-c359178cdbd9" class="image--center mx-auto" width="1356" height="868" loading="lazy"></p>
    <p>You can also right-click on a package and view further details like the dependencies, maintainer, size, and the installed files.</p>
    <p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1719313607397/33b7ad76-2492-4805-8133-35c8cd3c4a0a.png" alt="View a package's detail" class="image--center mx-auto" width="560" height="634" loading="lazy"></p>
    <h3 id="heading-74-installing-downloaded-packages-from-a-website">7.4. Installing downloaded packages from a website</h3>
    <p>You may want to install a package you have downloaded from a website, rather than from a software repository. These packages are called <code>.deb</code> files.</p>
    <p><strong>Using</strong><code>dpkg</code><strong>to install packages:</strong><code>dpkg</code> is a command-line tool used to install packages. To install a package with <strong>dpkg</strong>, open the Terminal and type the following:</p>
    <pre class="language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token builtin class-name">cd</span> directory
    <span class="token function">sudo</span> dpkg <span class="token parameter variable">-i</span> package_name.deb
    </code></pre>
    <p>Note: Replace "directory" with the directory where the package is stored and "package_name" with the filename of the package.</p>
    <p>Alternatively, you can right-click, select "Open With Other Application," and choose a GUI app of your choice.</p>
    <p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1719322161581/f16d83ac-ca9a-4502-a80c-e6a25dee5c68.png" alt="Installing a software using an app" class="image--center mx-auto" width="534" height="505" loading="lazy"></p>
    <p>💡 <strong>Tip:</strong> In Ubuntu, you can see a list of installed packages with <code>dpkg --list</code>.</p>
    <h2 id="heading-part-8-advanced-linux-topics">Part 8: Advanced Linux Topics</h2>
    <h3 id="heading-81-user-management">8.1. User Management</h3>
    <p>There can be multiple users with varying levels of access in a system. In Linux, the root user has the highest level of access and can perform any operation on the system. Regular users have limited access and can only perform operations they have been granted permission to do.</p>
    <h4 id="heading-what-is-a-user">What is a user?</h4>
    <p>A user account provides separation between different people and programs that can run commands.</p>
    <p>Humans identify users by a name, as names are easy to work with. But the system identifies users by a unique number called the user ID (UID).</p>
    <p>When human users log in using the provided username, they have to use a password to authorize themselves.</p>
    <p>User accounts form the foundations of system security. File ownership is also associated with user accounts and it enforces access control to the files. Every process has an associated user account that provides a layer of control for the admins.</p>
    <p>There are three main types of user accounts:</p>
    <ol>
    <li><p><strong>Superuser</strong>: The superuser has complete access to the system. The name of the superuser is <code>root</code>. It has a <code>UID</code> of 0.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p><strong>System user</strong>: The system user has user accounts that are used to run system services. These accounts are used to run system services and are not meant for human interaction.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p><strong>Regular user</strong>: Regular users are human users who have access to the system.</p>
    </li>
    </ol>
    <p>The <code>id</code> command displays the user ID and group ID of the current user.</p>

    <p>By default, systems use the <code>/etc/passwd</code> file to store user information.</p>
    <p>Here is a line from the <code>/etc/passwd</code> file:</p>
    <pre class="language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash">root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
    </code></pre>
    <p>The <code>/etc/passwd</code> file contains the following information about each user:</p>
    <ol>
    <li><p>Username: <code>root</code> – The username of the user account.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Password: <code>x</code> – The password in encrypted format for the user account that is stored in the <code>/etc/shadow</code> file for security reasons.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>User ID (UID): <code>0</code> – The unique numerical identifier for the user account.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Group ID (GID): <code>0</code> – The primary group identifier for the user account.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>User Info: <code>root</code> – The real name for the user account.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Home directory: <code>/root</code> – The home directory for the user account.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Shell: <code>/bin/bash</code> – The default shell for the user account. A system user might use <code>/sbin/nologin</code> if interactive logins are not allowed for that user.</p>
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h4 id="heading-what-is-a-group">What is a group?</h4>
    <p>A group is a collection of user accounts that share access and resources. Groups have group names to identify them. The system identifies groups by a unique number called the group ID (GID).</p>
    <p>By default, the information about groups is stored in the <code>/etc/group</code> file.</p>
    <p>Here is an entry from the <code>/etc/group</code> file:</p>
    <pre class="language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash">adm:x:4:syslog,john
    </code></pre>
    <p>Here is the breakdown of the fields in the given entry:</p>
    <ol>
    <li><p>Group name: <code>adm</code> – The name of the group.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Password: <code>x</code> – The password for the group is stored in the <code>/etc/gshadow</code> file for security reasons. The password is optional and appears empty if not set.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Group ID (GID): <code>4</code> – The unique numerical identifier for the group.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Group members: <code>syslog,john</code> – The list of usernames that are members of the group. In this case, the group <code>adm</code> has two members: <code>syslog</code> and <code>john</code>.</p>
    </li>
    </ol>
    <p>In this specific entry, the group name is <code>adm</code>, the group ID is <code>4</code>, and the group has two members: <code>syslog</code> and <code>john</code>. The password field is typically set to <code>x</code> to indicate that the group password is stored in the <code>/etc/gshadow</code> file.</p>
    <p>The groups are further divided into '<em>primary'</em> and '<em>supplementary'</em> groups.</p>
    <ul>
    <li><p>Primary Group: Each user is assigned one primary group by default. This group usually has the same name as the user and is created when the user account is made. Files and directories created by the user are typically owned by this primary group.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Supplementary Groups: These are extra groups a user can belong to in addition to their primary group. Users can be members of multiple supplementary groups. These groups let a user have permissions for resources shared among those groups. They help provide access to shared resources without affecting the system’s file permissions and keeping the security intact. While a user must belong to one primary group, belonging to supplementary groups is optional.</p>
    </li>
    </ul>
    <h4 id="heading-access-control-finding-and-understanding-file-permission">Access control: finding and understanding file permission</h4>
    <p>File ownership can be viewed using the <code>ls -l</code> command. The first column in the output of the <code>ls -l</code> command shows the permissions of the file. Other columns show the owner of the file and the group that the file belongs to.</p>
    <p><img src="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/04/image-146.png" alt="Detailed output of ls -l" width="1090" height="469" loading="lazy"></p>
    <p>Let's have a closer look into the <code>mode</code> column:</p>
    <p><img src="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/04/image-147.png" alt="Permission classes and file types" width="710" height="599" loading="lazy"></p>
    <p><strong>Mode</strong> defines two things:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><p><strong>File type:</strong> File type defines the type of the file. For regular files that contain simple data it is blank <code>-</code>. For other special file types the symbol is different. For a directory which is a special file, it is <code>d</code>. Special files are treated differently by the OS.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p><strong>Permission classes:</strong> The next set of characters define the permissions for user, group, and others respectively.<br>  – <strong>User</strong>: This is the owner of a file and owner of the file belongs to this class.<br>  – <strong>Group</strong>: The members of the file’s group belong to this class<br>  – <strong>Other</strong>: Any users that are not part of the user or group classes belong to this class.</p>
    </li>
    </ul>
    <p>💡<strong>Tip:</strong> Directory ownership can be viewed using the <code>ls -ld</code> command.</p>
    <h5 id="heading-how-to-read-symbolic-permissions-or-the-rwx-permissions">How to Read Symbolic Permissions or the <code>rwx</code> permissions</h5>
    <p>The <code>rwx</code> representation is known as the Symbolic representation of permissions. In the set of permissions,</p>
    <ul>
    <li><p><code>r</code> stands for <strong>read</strong>. It is indicated in the first character of the triad.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p><code>w</code> stands for <strong>write</strong>. It is indicated in the second character of the triad.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p><code>x</code> stands for <strong>execution</strong>. It is indicated in the third character of the triad.</p>
    </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Read:</strong></p>
    <p>For regular files, read permissions allow the file to be opened and read only. Users can't modify the file.</p>
    <p>Similarly for directories, read permissions allow the listing of directory content without any modification in the directory.</p>
    <p><strong>Write:</strong></p>
    <p>When files have write permissions, the user can modify (edit, delete) the file and save it.</p>
    <p>For folders, write permissions enable a user to modify its contents (create, delete, and rename the files inside it), and modify the contents of files that the user has write permissions to.</p>
    <p><strong>Examples of permissions in Linux</strong></p>
    <p>Now that we know how to read permissions, let's see some examples.</p>
    <ul>
    <li><p><code>-rwx------</code>: A file that is only accessible and executable by its owner.</p>
    <p>  <code>-rw-rw-r--</code>: A file that is open to modification by its owner and group but not by others.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p><code>drwxrwx---</code>: A directory that can be modified by its owner and group.</p>
    </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Execute:</strong></p>
    <p>For files, execute permissions allows the user to run an executable script. For directories, the user can access them, and access details about files in the directory.</p>
    <h5 id="heading-how-to-change-file-permissions-and-ownership-in-linux-using-chmod-and-chown">How to Change File Permissions and Ownership in Linux using <code>chmod</code> and <code>chown</code></h5>
    <p>Now that we know the basics of ownerships and permissions, let's see how we can modify permissions using the <code>chmod</code> command.</p>
    <p><strong>Syntax of</strong><code>chmod</code>:</p>
    <pre class="language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token function">chmod</span> permissions filename
    </code></pre>
    <p>Where,</p>
    <ul>
    <li><p><code>permissions</code> can be read, write, execute or a combination of them.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p><code>filename</code> is the name of the file for which the permissions need to change. This parameter can also be a list if files to change permissions in bulk.</p>
    </li>
    </ul>
    <p>We can change permissions using two modes:</p>
    <ol>
    <li><p><strong>Symbolic mode</strong>: this method uses symbols like <code>u</code>, <code>g</code>, <code>o</code> to represent users, groups, and others. Permissions are represented as  <code>r, w, x</code> for read, write, and execute, respectively. You can modify permissions using +, - and =.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p><strong>Absolute mode</strong>: this method represents permissions as 3-digit octal numbers ranging from 0-7.</p>

    </div><p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
    <p>Suppose I have a script and I want to make it executable for the owner of the file <code>zaira</code>.</p>
    <p>Current file permissions are as follows:</p>

    <p>To add execution rights (<code>x</code>) to owner (<code>u</code>) using symbolic mode, we can use the command below:</p>
    <pre class="language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token function">chmod</span> u+x mymotd.sh
    </code></pre>
    <p><strong>Output:</strong></p>
    <p>Now, we can see that the execution permissions have been added for owner <code>zaira</code>.</p>

    <li><p>Removing <code>read</code> and <code>write</code> permission for <code>group</code> and <code>others</code>: <code>chmod go-rw</code>.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Removing <code>read</code> permissions for <code>others</code>: <code>chmod o-r</code>.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Assigning <code>write</code> permission to <code>group</code> and overriding existing permission: <code>chmod g=w</code>.</p>
    </li>
    </ul>
    <h5 id="heading-how-to-change-permissions-using-absolute-mode">How to Change Permissions using Absolute Mode</h5>
    <p>Absolute mode uses numbers to represent permissions and mathematical operators to modify them.</p>
    <p>The below table shows how we can assign relevant permissions:</p>

    </tbody>
    </table>
    </div><p><strong>Example</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Set <code>read</code> (add 4) for <code>user</code>, <code>read</code> (add 4) and <code>execute</code> (add 1) for group, and only <code>execute</code> (add 1) for others.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><code>chmod 451 file-name</code></p>
    <p>This is how we performed the calculation:</p>

    <p>Note that this is the same as <code>r--r-x--x</code>.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Remove <code>execution</code> rights from <code>other</code> and <code>group</code>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To remove execution from <code>other</code> and <code>group</code>, subtract 1 from the execute part of last 2 octets.</p>

    <p>Next, we will learn how to change the ownership of a file. You can change the ownership of a file or folder using the <code>chown</code> command. In some cases, changing ownership requires <code>sudo</code> permissions.</p>
    <p>Syntax of <code>chown</code>:</p>
    <pre class="language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token function">chown</span> user filename
    </code></pre>
    <h5 id="heading-how-to-change-user-ownership-with-chown">How to change user ownership with <code>chown</code></h5>
    <p>Let's transfer the ownership from user <code>zaira</code> to user <code>news</code>.</p>
    <p><code>chown news mymotd.sh</code></p>

    <h5 id="heading-how-to-change-user-and-group-ownership-simultaneously">How to change user and group ownership simultaneously</h5>
    <p>We can also use <code>chown</code> to change user and group simultaneously.</p>
    <pre class="language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token function">chown</span> user:group filename
    </code></pre>
    <h5 id="heading-how-to-change-directory-ownership">How to change directory ownership</h5>
    <p>You can change ownership recursively for contents in a directory. The example below changes the ownership of the <code>/opt/script</code> folder to allow user <code>admin</code>.</p>
    <pre class="language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token function">chown</span> <span class="token parameter variable">-R</span> admin /opt/script
    </code></pre>
    <h5 id="heading-how-to-change-group-ownership">How to change group ownership</h5>
    <p>In case we only need to change the group owner, we can use <code>chown</code> by preceding the group name by a colon <code>:</code></p>
    <pre class="language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token function">chown</span> :admins /opt/script
    </code></pre>
    <h5 id="heading-how-to-switch-between-users">How to switch between users</h5>
    <p>You can switch between users using the <code>su</code> command.</p>
    <pre class="language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token punctuation">[</span>user01@host ~<span class="token punctuation">]</span>$ <span class="token function">su</span> user02
    Password:
    <span class="token punctuation">[</span>user02@host ~<span class="token punctuation">]</span>$
    </code></pre>
    <h5 id="heading-how-to-gain-superuser-access">How to gain superuser access</h5>
    <p>The superuser or the root user has the highest level of access on a Linux system. The root user can perform any operation on the system. The root user can access all files and directories, install and remove software, and modify or override system configurations.</p>
    <p>With great power comes great responsibility. If the root user is compromised, someone can gain complete control over the system. It is advised to use the root user account only when necessary.</p>
    <p>If you omit the username, the <code>su</code> command switches to the root user account by default.</p>
    <pre class="language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token punctuation">[</span>user01@host ~<span class="token punctuation">]</span>$ <span class="token function">su</span>
    Password:
    <span class="token punctuation">[</span>root@host ~<span class="token punctuation">]</span><span class="token comment">#</span>
    </code></pre>
    <p>Another variation of the <code>su</code> command is <code>su -</code>. The <code>su</code> command switches to the root user account but does not change the environment variables. The <code>su -</code> command switches to the root user account and changes the environment variables to those of the target user.</p>
    <h5 id="heading-running-commands-with-sudo">Running commands with sudo</h5>
    <p>To run commands as the <code>root</code> user without switching to the <code>root</code> user account, you can use the <code>sudo</code> command. The <code>sudo</code> command allows you to run commands with elevated privileges.</p>
    <p>Running commands with <code>sudo</code> is a safer option rather than running the commands as the <code>root</code> user. This is because, only a specific set of users can be granted permission to run commands with <code>sudo</code>. This is defined in the <code>/etc/sudoers</code> file.</p>
    <p>Also, <code>sudo</code> logs all commands that are run with it, providing an audit trail of who ran which commands and when.</p>
    <p>In Ubuntu, you can find the audit logs here:</p>
    <pre class="language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token function">cat</span> /var/log/auth.log <span class="token operator">|</span> <span class="token function">grep</span> <span class="token function">sudo</span>
    </code></pre>
    <p>For a user that does not have access to <code>sudo</code>, it gets flagged in logs and prompts a message like this:</p>
    <pre class="language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash">user01 is not <span class="token keyword">in</span> the sudoers file.  This incident will be reported.
    </code></pre>

    <h5 id="heading-creating-users-from-the-command-line">Creating users from the command line</h5>
    <p>The command used to add a new user is:</p>
    <pre class="language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token function">sudo</span> <span class="token function">useradd</span> username
    </code></pre>
    <p>This command sets up a user's home directory and creates a private group designated by the user's username. Currently, the account lacks a valid password, preventing the user from logging in until a password is created.</p>
    <h5 id="heading-modifying-existing-users">Modifying existing users</h5>
    <p>The <code>usermod</code> command is used to modify existing users. Here are some of the common options used with the <code>usermod</code> command:</p>
    <p>Here are some examples of the <code>usermod</code> command in Linux:</p>
    <ol>
    <li><p><strong>Change a user's login name:</strong></p>

    <h3 id="heading-82-connecting-to-remote-servers-via-ssh">8.2 Connecting to Remote Servers via SSH</h3>
    <p>Accessing remote servers is one of the essential tasks for system administrators. You can connect to different servers or access databases through your local machine and execute commands, all using SSH.</p>
    <p><strong>What is the SSH protocol?</strong></p>
    <p>SSH stands for Secure Shell. It is a cryptographic network protocol that allows secure communication between two systems.</p>
    <p>The default port for SSH is <code>22</code>.</p>
    <p>The two participants while communicating via SSH are:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><p>The server: the machine that you want access to.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>The client: The system that you are accessing the server from.</p>
    </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Connection to a server follows these steps:</p>
    <ol>
    <li><p>Initiate Connection: The client sends a connection request to the server.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Exchange of Keys: The server sends its public key to the client. Both agree on the encryption methods to use.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Session Key Generation: The client and server use the Diffie-Hellman key exchange to create a shared session key.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Client Authentication: The client logs in to the server using a password, private key, or another method.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Secure Communication: After authentication, the client and server communicate securely with encryption.</p>
    </li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>How to connect to a remote server using SSH?</strong></p>
    <p>The <code>ssh</code> command is a built-in utility in Linux and also the default one. It makes accessing servers quite easy and secure.</p>
    <p>Here, we are talking about how the client would make a connection to the server.</p>
    <p>Prior to connecting to a server, you need to have the following information:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><p>The IP address or the domain name of the server.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>The username and password of the server.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>The port number that you have access to in the server.</p>
    </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The basic syntax of the <code>ssh</code> command is:</p>
    <pre class="language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token function">ssh</span> username@server_ip
    </code></pre>
    <p>For example, if your username is <code>john</code> and the server IP is <code>192.168.1.10</code>, the command would be:</p>
    <pre class="language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token function">ssh</span> john@192.168.1.10
    </code></pre>
    <p>After that, you'll be prompted to enter the secret password. Your screen will look similar to this:</p>
    <pre class="language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash">john@192.168.1.10's password:

    <p>Now you can execute the relevant commands on the server <code>192.168.1.10</code>.</p>
    <p>⚠️ The default port for ssh is <code>22</code> but it is also vulnerable, as hackers will likely attempt here first. Your server can expose another port and share the access with you. To connect to a different port, use the <code>-p</code> flag.</p>

    <p>A log file usually contains the following columns:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><p>Timestamp: The date and time when the event occurred.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Log Level: The severity of the event (INFO, DEBUG, WARN, ERROR).</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Component: The component of the system that generated the event (Startup, Config, Database, User, Security, Network, Email, API, Session, Shutdown).</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Message: A description of the event that occurred.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Additional Information: Additional information related to the event.</p>
    </li>
    </ul>
    <p>In real-time systems, log files tend to be thousands of lines long and are generated every second. They can be very wordy depending on the configuration. Every column in a log file is a piece of information that can be used to track down issues. This makes log files difficult to read and understand manually.</p>
    <p>This is where log parsing comes in. Log parsing is the process of extracting useful information from log files. It involves breaking down the log files into smaller, more manageable pieces, and extracting the relevant information.</p>
    <p>The filtered information can also be useful for creating alerts, reports, and dashboards.</p>
    <p>In this section, you will explore some techniques for parsing log files in Linux.</p>

    <p>Grep is a built-in bash utility. It stands for "global regular expression print". Grep is used to match strings in files.</p>
    <p>Here are some common uses of <code>grep</code>:</p>
    <ol>
    <li><p><strong>Search for a specific string in a file:</strong></p>
    <pre class="language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"> <span class="token function">grep</span> <span class="token string">"search_string"</span> filename
    </code></pre>
    <p> This command searches for "search_string" in the file named <code>filename</code>.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p><strong>Search recursively in directories:</strong></p>
    <pre class="language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"> <span class="token function">grep</span> <span class="token parameter variable">-r</span> <span class="token string">"search_string"</span> /path/to/directory
    </code></pre>
    <p> This command searches for "<code>search_string"</code> in all files within the specified directory and its subdirectories.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p><strong>Ignore case while searching:</strong></p>
    <pre class="language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"> <span class="token function">grep</span> <span class="token parameter variable">-i</span> <span class="token string">"search_string"</span> filename
    </code></pre>
    <p> This command performs a case-insensitive search for "search_string" in the file named <code>filename</code>.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p><strong>Display line numbers with matching lines:</strong></p>
    <pre class="language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"> <span class="token function">grep</span> <span class="token parameter variable">-n</span> <span class="token string">"search_string"</span> filename
    </code></pre>
    <p> This command shows the line numbers along with the matching lines in the file named <code>filename</code>.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p><strong>Count the number of matching lines:</strong></p>
    <pre class="language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"> <span class="token function">grep</span> <span class="token parameter variable">-c</span> <span class="token string">"search_string"</span> filename
    </code></pre>
    <p> This command counts the number of lines that contain "search_string" in the file named <code>filename</code>.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p><strong>Invert match to display lines that do not match:</strong></p>
    <pre class="language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"> <span class="token function">grep</span> <span class="token parameter variable">-v</span> <span class="token string">"search_string"</span> filename
    </code></pre>
    <p> This command displays all lines that do not contain "search_string" in the file named <code>filename</code>.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p><strong>Search for a whole word:</strong></p>
    <pre class="language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"> <span class="token function">grep</span> <span class="token parameter variable">-w</span> <span class="token string">"word"</span> filename
    </code></pre>
    <p> This command searches for the whole word "word" in the file named <code>filename</code>.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p><strong>Use extended regular expressions:</strong></p>
    <pre class="language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"> <span class="token function">grep</span> <span class="token parameter variable">-E</span> <span class="token string">"pattern"</span> filename
    </code></pre>
    <p> This command allows the use of extended regular expressions for more complex pattern matching in the file named <code>filename</code>.</p>
    </li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>💡 Tip:</strong> If there are multiple files in a folder, you can use the below command to find the list of files containing the desired strings.</p>
    <pre class="language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token comment"># find the list of files containing the desired strings</span>
    <span class="token function">grep</span> <span class="token parameter variable">-l</span> <span class="token string">"String to Match"</span> /path/to/directory
    </code></pre>
    <h4 id="heading-text-extraction-using-sed">Text extraction using <code>sed</code></h4>
    <p><code>sed</code> stands for "stream editor". It processes data stream-wise, meaning it reads data one line at a time. <code>sed</code> allows you to search for patterns and perform actions on the lines that match those patterns.</p>
    <p><strong>Basic syntax of</strong><code>sed</code>:</p>
    <p>The basic syntax of <code>sed</code> is as follows:</p>
    <pre class="language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token function">sed</span> <span class="token punctuation">[</span>options<span class="token punctuation">]</span> <span class="token string">'command'</span> file_name
    </code></pre>
    <p>Here, <code>command</code> is used to perform operations like substitution, deletion, insertion, and so on, on the text data. The filename is the name of the file you want to process.</p>
    <p><code>sed</code><strong>usage:</strong></p>
    <p><strong>1. Substitution:</strong></p>
    <p>The <code>s</code> flag is used to replace text. The <code>old-text</code> is replaced with <code>new-text</code>:</p>
    <pre class="language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token function">sed</span> <span class="token string">'s/old-text/new-text/'</span> filename
    </code></pre>
    <p>For example, to change all instances of "error" to "warning" in the log file <code>system.log</code>:</p>
    <pre class="language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token function">sed</span> <span class="token string">'s/error/warning/'</span> system.log
    </code></pre>
    <p><strong>2. Printing lines containing a specific pattern:</strong></p>
    <p>Using <code>sed</code> to filter and display lines that match a specific pattern:</p>
    <pre class="language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token function">sed</span> <span class="token parameter variable">-n</span> <span class="token string">'/pattern/p'</span> filename
    </code></pre>
    <p>For instance, to find all lines containing "ERROR":</p>
    <pre class="language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token function">sed</span> <span class="token parameter variable">-n</span> <span class="token string">'/ERROR/p'</span> system.log
    </code></pre>
    <p><strong>3. Deleting lines containing a specific pattern:</strong></p>
    <p>You can delete lines from the output that match a specific pattern:</p>
    <pre class="language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token function">sed</span> <span class="token string">'/pattern/d'</span> filename
    </code></pre>
    <p>For example, to remove all lines containing "DEBUG":</p>
    <pre class="language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token function">sed</span> <span class="token string">'/DEBUG/d'</span> system.log
    </code></pre>
    <p><strong>4. Extracting specific fields from a log line:</strong></p>
    <p>You can use regular expressions to extract parts of lines. Suppose each log line starts with a date in the format "YYYY-MM-DD". You could extract just the date from each line:</p>
    <pre class="language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token function">sed</span> <span class="token parameter variable">-n</span> <span class="token string">'s/^\([0-9]\{4\}-[0-9]\{2\}-[0-9]\{2\}\).*/\1/p'</span> system.log
    </code></pre>
    <h4 id="heading-text-parsing-with-awk">Text parsing with <code>awk</code></h4>
    <p><code>awk</code> has the ability to easily split each line into fields. It's well-suited for processing structured text like log files.</p>
    <p><strong>Basic syntax of</strong><code>awk</code></p>
    <p>The basic syntax of <code>awk</code> is:</p>
    <pre class="language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token function">awk</span> <span class="token string">'pattern { action }'</span> file_name
    </code></pre>
    <p>Here, <code>pattern</code> is a condition that must be met for the <code>action</code> to be performed. If the pattern is omitted, the action is performed on every line.</p>
    <p>In the coming examples, you'll use this log file as an example:</p>

    <p>This command will extract all lines where the 3rd field is "INFO".</p>
    <p>💡 <strong>Tip:</strong> The default separator in <code>awk</code> is a space. If your log file uses a different separator, you can specify it using the <code>-F</code> option. For example, if your log file uses a colon as a separator, you can use <code>awk -F: '{ print $1 }' logfile.log</code> to extract the first field.</p>
    <h4 id="heading-parsing-log-files-with-cut">Parsing log files with <code>cut</code></h4>
    <p>The <code>cut</code> command is a simple yet powerful command used to extract sections of text from each line of input. As log files are structured and each field is delimited by a specific character, such as a space, tab, or a custom delimiter, <code>cut</code> does a very good job of extracting those specific fields.</p>
    <p>The basic syntax of the cut command is:</p>
    <pre class="language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token function">cut</span> <span class="token punctuation">[</span>options<span class="token punctuation">]</span> <span class="token punctuation">[</span>file<span class="token punctuation">]</span>
    </code></pre>
    <p>Some commonly used options for the cut command:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><p><code>-d</code> : Specifies a delimiter used as the field separator.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p><code>-f</code> : Selects the fields to be displayed.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p><code>-c</code> : Specifies character positions.</p>
    </li>
    </ul>
    <p>For example, the command below would extract the first field (separated by a space) from each line of the log file:</p>
    <pre class="language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token function">cut</span> <span class="token parameter variable">-d</span> <span class="token string">' '</span> <span class="token parameter variable">-f</span> <span class="token number">1</span> logfile.log
    </code></pre>
    <p><strong>Examples of using</strong><code>cut</code><strong>for log parsing</strong></p>
    <p>Assume you have a log file structured as follows, where fields are space-separated:</p>

    <h3 id="heading-84-managing-linux-processes-via-command-line">8.4. Managing Linux Processes via Command Line</h3>
    <p>A process is a running instance of a program. A process consists of:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><p>An address space of the allocated memory.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Process states.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Properties such as ownership, security attributes, and resource usage.</p>
    </li>
    </ul>
    <p>A process also has an environment that consists of:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><p>Local and global variables</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>The current scheduling context</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Allocated system resources, such as network ports or file descriptors.</p>
    </li>
    </ul>
    <p>When you run the <code>ls -l</code> command, the operating system creates a new process to execute the command. The process has an ID, a state, and runs until the command completes.</p>
    <h4 id="heading-understanding-process-creation-and-lifecycle">Understanding process creation and lifecycle</h4>
    <p>In Ubuntu, all processes originate from the initial system process called <code>systemd</code>, which is the first process started by the kernel during boot.</p>
    <p>The <code>systemd</code> process has a process ID (PID) of <code>1</code> and is responsible for initializing the system, starting and managing other processes, and handling system services. All other processes on the system are descendants of <code>systemd</code>.</p>
    <p>A parent process duplicates its own address space (fork) to create a new (child) process structure. Each new process is assigned a unique process ID (PID) for tracking and security purposes. The PID and the parent's process ID (PPID) are part of the new process environment. Any process can create a child process.</p>
    <p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1719584071059/f24fac4b-18f3-4a39-8659-93d32c533256.png" alt="Process and its initialization to parent and child" class="image--center mx-auto" width="473" height="649" loading="lazy"></p>
    <p>Through the fork routine, a child process inherits security identities, previous and current file descriptors, port and resource privileges, environment variables, and program code. A child process may then execute its own program code.</p>
    <p>Typically, a parent process sleeps while the child process runs, setting a request (wait) to be notified when the child completes.</p>
    <p>Upon exiting, the child process has already closed or discarded its resources and environment. The only remaining resource, known as a zombie, is an entry in the process table. The parent, signaled awake when the child exits, cleans the process table of the child's entry, thus freeing the last resource of the child process. The parent process then continues executing its own program code.</p>
    <h4 id="heading-understanding-process-states">Understanding process states</h4>
    <p>Processes in Linux assume different states during their lifecycle. The state of a process indicates what the process is currently doing and how it is interacting with the system. The processes transition between states based on their execution status and the system's scheduling algorithm.</p>
    <p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1719584116150/3054dfe2-c42c-4d62-9e12-e3aec479d53a.png" alt="Linux process states and transitions" class="image--center mx-auto" width="1079" height="742" loading="lazy"></p>
    <p>The processes in a Linux system can be in one of the following states:</p>

    <tr>
    <td><strong>Sleeping (S)</strong></td><td>Process is waiting for an event (for example, I/O operation) to complete and can be easily awakened.</td></tr>
    <tr>
    <td><strong>Sleeping (uninterruptible) (D)</strong></td><td>Process is in an uninterruptible sleep state, waiting for a specific condition (usually I/O) to complete, and cannot be interrupted by signals.</td></tr>
    <tr>
    <td><strong>Sleeping (disk sleep) (K)</strong></td><td>Process is waiting for disk I/O operations to complete.</td></tr>
    <tr>
    <td><strong>Sleeping (idle) (I)</strong></td><td>Process is idle, not doing any work, and waiting for an event to occur.</td></tr>
    <tr>
    <td><strong>Stopped (T)</strong></td><td>Process execution has been stopped, typically by a signal, and can be resumed later.</td></tr>
    <tr>

    </div><h3 id="heading-85-standard-input-and-output-streams-in-linux">8.5. Standard Input and Output Streams in Linux</h3>
    <p>Reading an input and writing an output is an essential part of understanding the command line and shell scripting. In Linux, every process has three default streams:</p>
    <ol>
    <li><p>Standard Input (<code>stdin</code>): This stream is used for input, typically from the keyboard. When a program reads from <code>stdin</code>, it receives data entered by the user or redirected from a file. A file descriptor is a unique identifier that the operating system assigns to an open file in order to keep track of open files.</p>
    <p> The file descriptor for <code>stdin</code> is <code>0</code>.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Standard Output (<code>stdout</code>): This is the default output stream where a process writes its output. By default, the standard output is the terminal. The output can also be redirected to a file or another program. The file descriptor for <code>stdout</code> is <code>1</code>.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Standard Error (<code>stderr</code>): This is the default error stream where a process writes its error messages. By default, the standard error is the terminal, allowing error messages to be seen even if <code>stdout</code> is redirected. The file descriptor for <code>stderr</code> is <code>2</code>.</p>
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h4 id="heading-redirection-and-pipelines">Redirection and Pipelines</h4>
    <p><strong>Redirection:</strong> You can redirect the error and output streams to files or other commands. For example:</p>
    <pre class="language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token comment"># Redirecting stdout to a file</span>
    <span class="token function">ls</span> <span class="token operator">&gt;</span> output.txt
    
    <span class="token comment"># Redirecting stderr to a file</span>
    <span class="token function">ls</span> non_existent_directory <span class="token operator"><span class="token file-descriptor important">2</span>&gt;</span> error.txt
    
    <span class="token comment"># Redirecting both stdout and stderr to a file</span>
    <span class="token function">ls</span> non_existent_directory <span class="token operator">&gt;</span> all_output.txt <span class="token operator"><span class="token file-descriptor important">2</span>&gt;</span><span class="token file-descriptor important">&amp;1</span>
    </code></pre>
    <p>In the last command,</p>
    <ul>
    <li><p><code>ls non_existent_directory</code>: lists the contents of a directory named non_existent_directory. Since this directory does not exist, <code>ls</code> will generate an error message.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p><code>&gt; all_output.txt</code>: The <code>&gt;</code> operator redirects the standard output (<code>stdout</code>) of the <code>ls</code> command to the file <code>all_output.txt</code>. If the file does not exist, it will be created. If it does exist, its contents will be overwritten.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p><code>2&gt;&amp;1:</code>: Here, <code>2</code> represents the file descriptor for standard error (<code>stderr</code>). <code>&amp;1</code> represents the file descriptor for standard output (<code>stdout</code>). The <code>&amp;</code> character is used to specify that <code>1</code> is not the file name but a file descriptor.</p>
    </li>
    </ul>
    <p>So, <code>2&gt;&amp;1</code> means "redirect stderr (2) to wherever stdout (1) is currently going," which in this case is the file <code>all_output.txt</code>. Therefore, both the output (if there were any) and the error message from <code>ls</code> will be written to <code>all_output.txt</code>.</p>
    <p><strong>Pipelines:</strong></p>
    <p>You can use pipes (<code>|</code>) to pass the output of one command as the input to another:</p>
    <pre class="language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token function">ls</span> <span class="token operator">|</span> <span class="token function">grep</span> image

    <h3 id="heading-86-automation-in-linux-automate-tasks-with-cron-jobs">8.6 Automation in Linux – Automate Tasks with Cron Jobs</h3>
    <p>Cron is a powerful utility for job scheduling that is available in Unix-like operating systems. By configuring cron, you can set up automated jobs to run on a daily, weekly, monthly, or other specific time basis. The automation capabilities provided by cron play a crucial role in Linux system administration.</p>
    <p>The <code>crond</code> daemon (a type of computer program that runs in the background) enables cron functionality. The cron reads the <strong>crontab</strong> (cron tables) for running predefined scripts.</p>
    <p>By using a specific syntax, you can configure a cron job to schedule scripts or other commands to run automatically.</p>
    <p><strong>What are cron jobs in Linux?</strong></p>
    <p>Any task that you schedule through crons is called a cron job.</p>
    <p>Now, let's see how cron jobs work.</p>
    <h4 id="heading-how-to-control-access-to-crons">How to control access to crons</h4>
    <p>In order to use cron jobs, an admin needs to allow cron jobs to be added for users in the <code>/etc/cron.allow</code> file.</p>
    <p>If you get a prompt like this, it means you don't have permission to use cron.</p>
    <p><img src="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/11/image-51.png" alt="Cron job addition denied for user John." width="583" height="283" loading="lazy"></p>
    <p>To allow John to use crons, include his name in <code>/etc/cron.allow</code>. Create the file if it doesn't exist. This will allow John to create and edit cron jobs.</p>
    <p><img src="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/11/image-52.png" alt="Allowing John in file cron.allow" width="442" height="38" loading="lazy"></p>
    <p>Users can also be denied access to cron job access by entering their usernames in the file <code>/etc/cron.d/cron.deny</code>.</p>
    <h4 id="heading-how-to-add-cron-jobs-in-linux">How to add cron jobs in Linux</h4>
    <p>First, to use cron jobs, you'll need to check the status of the cron service. If cron is not installed, you can easily download it through the package manager. Just use this to check:</p>
    <pre class="language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token comment"># Check cron service on Linux system</span>
    <span class="token function">sudo</span> systemctl status cron.service
    </code></pre>
    <h4 id="heading-cron-job-syntax">Cron job syntax</h4>
    <p>Crontabs use the following flags for adding and listing cron jobs:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><p><code>crontab -e</code>: edits crontab entries to add, delete, or edit cron jobs.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p><code>crontab -l</code>: list all the cron jobs for the current user.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p><code>crontab -u username -l</code>: list another user's crons.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p><code>crontab -u username -e</code>: edit another user's crons.</p>
    </li>
    </ul>
    <p>When you list crons and they exist, you'll see something like this:</p>

    <p><strong>How to troubleshoot crons</strong></p>
    <p>Crons are really helpful, but they might not always work as intended. Fortunately, there are some effective methods you can use to troubleshoot them.</p>
    <p><strong>1. Check the schedule.</strong></p>
    <p>First, you can try verifying the schedule that's set for the cron. You can do that with the syntax you saw in the above sections.</p>
    <p><strong>2</strong>. <strong>Check cron logs.</strong></p>
    <p>First, you need to check if the cron has run at the intended time or not. In Ubuntu, you can verify this from the cron logs located at <code>/var/log/syslog</code>.</p>
    <p>If there is an entry in these logs at the correct time, it means the cron has run according to the schedule you set.</p>
    <p>Below are the logs of our cron job example. Note the first column which shows the timestamp. The path of the script is also mentioned at the end of the line. Line #1, 3, and 5 show that the script ran as intended.</p>

    <h4 id="heading-system-activity-report-with-sar">System activity report with <code>sar</code></h4>
    <p>The <code>sar</code> command in Linux is a powerful tool for collecting, reporting, and saving system activity information. It's part of the <code>sysstat</code> package and is widely used for monitoring system performance over time.</p>
    <p>To use <code>sar</code> you first need to install <code>syssstat</code> using <code>sudo apt install sysstat</code>.</p>
    <p>Once installed, start the service with <code>sudo systemctl start sysstat</code>.</p>
    <p>Verify the status with <code>sudo systemctl status sysstat</code>.</p>
    <p>Once the status is active, the system will start collecting various stats that you can use to access and analyze historical data. We'll see that in detail soon.</p>
    <p>The syntax of the <code>sar</code> command is as follows:</p>

    <p><strong>Why do we need to understand monitoring?</strong></p>
    <p>System monitoring is an important aspect of system administration. Critical applications demand a high level of proactiveness to prevent failure and reduce the outage impact.</p>
    <p>Linux offers very powerful tools to gauge system health. In this section, you'll learn about the various methods available to check your system's health and identify the bottlenecks.</p>
    <h4 id="heading-find-load-average-and-system-uptime">Find load average and system uptime</h4>
    <p>System reboots may occur which can sometimes mess up some configurations. To check how long the machine has been up, use the command: <code>uptime</code>. In addition to the uptime, the command also displays load average.</p>

    <p>Load average is the system load over the last 1, 5, and 15 minutes. A quick glance indicates whether the system load appears to be increasing or decreasing over time.</p>
    <p>Note: Ideal CPU queue is <code>0</code>. This is only possible when there are no waiting queues for the CPU.</p>
    <p>Per-CPU load can be calculated by dividing load average with the total number of CPUs available.</p>

    <p>The top command displays a dynamic view of the system's processes, displaying a summary header followed by a process or thread list. Unlike its static counterpart <code>ps</code>, <code>top</code> continuously refreshes the system stats.</p>
    <p>With <code>top</code>, you can see well-organised details in a compact window. There a number of flags, shortcuts, and highlighting methods that come along with <code>top</code>.</p>

    <p>The network aspect should not be ignored as network glitches are common and may impact the system and traffic flows. Common network issues include port exhaustion, port choking, unreleased resources, and so on.</p>
    <p>To identify such issues, we need to understand port states.</p>
    <p>Some of the port states are explained briefly here:</p>
    <div class="hn-table">
    <table>

    <td>LISTEN</td><td>Represents ports that are waiting for a connection request from any remote TCP and port.</td></tr>
    <tr>
    <td>ESTABLISHED</td><td>Represents connections that are open and data received can be delivered to the destination.</td></tr>
    <tr>
    <td>TIME WAIT</td><td>Represents waiting time to ensure acknowledgment of its connection termination request.</td></tr>
    <tr>
    <td>FIN WAIT2</td><td>Represents waiting for a connection termination request from the remote TCP.</td></tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>
    </div><p>Let's explore how we can analyze port-related information in Linux.</p>
    <p><strong>Port ranges:</strong> Port ranges are defined in the system, and range can be increased/decreased accordingly. In the below snippet, the range is from <code>15000</code> to <code>65000</code>, which makes a total of <code>50000</code> (65000 - 15000) available ports. If utilized ports are reaching or exceeding this limit, then there is an issue.</p>

    <p>Packets can also be captured at runtime using <code>tcpdump</code>. We'll look into it later.</p>
    <h4 id="heading-gathering-stats-for-issue-post-mortem">Gathering stats for issue post mortem</h4>
    <p>It is always a good practice to gather certain stats that would be useful for identifying the root cause later. Usually, after system reboot or services restart, we loose the earlier system snapshot and logs.</p>
    <p>Below are some of the methods to capture system snapshot.</p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Logs Backup</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Before making any changes, copy log files to another location. This is crucial for understanding what condition the system was in during time of issue. Sometimes log files are the only window to look into past system states as other runtime stats are lost.</p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>TCP Dump</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Tcpdump is a command-line utility that allows you to capture and analyze incoming and outgoing network traffic. It is mostly used to help troubleshoot network issues. If you feel that system traffic is being impacted, take <code>tcpdump</code> as follows:</p>
    <pre class="language-bash" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token function">sudo</span> tcpdump <span class="token parameter variable">-i</span> any <span class="token parameter variable">-w</span>
    
    <span class="token comment"># Where,</span>
    <span class="token comment"># -i any captures traffic from all interfaces</span>
    <span class="token comment"># -w specifies the output filename</span>
    
    <span class="token comment"># Stop the command after a few mins as the file size may increase</span>
    <span class="token comment"># use file extension as .pcap</span>
    </code></pre>
    <p>Once <code>tcpdump</code> is captured, you can use tools like Wireshark to visually analyze the traffic.</p>
